Main features:

- no elements in HTML body, no CSS file - all the content, style & interactivity coded in jQuery, jQuery UI, and Bootstrap;
- the guessed pairs are dynamically listed in an additional box on the right;
- a congratulations box.


NOTE: Non-responsive web design - this project is intended to show the functionality of jQuery/jQuery UI/Bootstrap as nothing is coded in HTML/CSS files.
